1. Perform the following operations using Numpy
a. Generate random numbers between 20 and 40
b. Create a 6X6 array with random values and find the minimum and maximum
values
c. Generate a random array of size 9X3 and extract the first five rows of the array
and store them into a variable
d. Write a NumPy program to check two random arrays are equal or not.
2. Extract from the array below:
np.array([3,2,4,6,9,12,14,16,18,21,24,27,,40,42,45,48,99,100]) with Boolean masking
all the number
 which are divisible by 3
 Which are not divisible by 2
 which are divisible by 5
 which are divisible by 3 and 5
 which are divisible by 5 and set them to 55
